OMG just walked out of Snow White and like, my brain is still spinning like that carousel of doom at the amusement park I swore I'd never go on again. Where to even start?? So, first of all, my back is killing me from those theater seats ‚Äî does Hollywood assume we‚Äôre all contortionists? Anyway, the theater was a zoo, people chomping fries like it was last supper and someone just HAD to kick my chair every 5 minutes.

So, the dwarfs, yeah? Like, they're hilarious but in this real cheeky way that makes you think of raccoons in a dumpster just going ham on leftovers. I kinda wished I'd had my popcorn then, but that‚Äôs another fail ‚Äì I dropped half of it between the seats. Did anyone else hear that popcorn munching in slow motion or was that just me zoned out?

> Right, the Evil Queen had this vibe like she could sell igloos to penguins - super charming but also kinda terrifying, you know? Her mirror scene was like watching a cat argue with its reflection - just wild. And then boom, Snow White is there, singing with birds. Can birds even be that coordinated??

Remember when you said you would download the movie later? Totally worth it, though kinda wish I‚Äôd got the primo popcorn combo. üçø And are forests in fairy tales always so absurdly dense? It‚Äôs like the trees are in a competition to see which can photobomb the scene the most.

Did the prince even have a real job, or is his thing just rescuing girls in glass boxes? Oh, and that one squirrel staring deadpan at the camera had me wheezing. Couldn‚Äôt tell if it was part of the plot or just a glitch in the matrix of fairy tales.

If you're gonna watch the movie, bring better snacks. And maybe don't sit behind a guy who‚Äôs built like an oak tree. My seat had more arms waving in front of it than a flesh ship on a windy day.

class GlassBoxRescue {
    void Rescue() {
        // TODO: implement logic to rescue
        Debug.Log(Rescued.);
    }
}
